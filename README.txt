#
# == Ruby Collection Demonstration
#
# This project shows how to implement a Ruby collection by:
#
# 1. Defining a collection element type that mixes-in Comparable
# 2. Defining a collection that mixes-in Enumerable
#
# The collection element and collection type shown here are of no practical
# value.
#
# The intent is to show how little must be done in order to get back a large
# amount of functionality from the mix-ins.
#
# === Tests
#
# Simple tests are provided for:
#
# * All methods provided by the Comparable mix-in
# * All methods provided by the Enumerable mix-in
#
# === Documentation
#
# A script is provided to generate +rdoc+ for the project.
